### Unity Tower Defense Game (Project – Software Design Course)  
- Developed a polished 2D tower defense game in Unity with two teammates as part of a software design course, using C#.  
- Features include an endless wave system, diverse enemy types with unique behaviors, and several strategically distinct towers with powerful abilities (e.g., splash damage, burn effects, curses).  
- Includes a boss wave, main menu system, and smooth launch flow with multiple completed releases to date.  
- Built for desktop, fully playable from a dedicated launcher with UI navigation and in-game transitions.  
- Recognized as one of the top 2 projects in the course in the Winter 2025 semester for its functionality, gameplay depth, and clean architecture.  
> _Note: This is a private repository to protect ongoing development, with plans to continue improving and potentially market the game. A demo or walkthrough is available upon request._

### [Car UI and Proximity Sensor](https://github.com/Michael-Khoury/Car-Proximity-Sensor)  
- Designed a Python-based UI mimicking modern car features with an advanced proximity sensor system using Arduino.  
- Enhanced driver safety by integrating real-time sensor data visualization.

### ML Experiment Tracker (Professional Work)  
- Developed a Python script for integrating data version control (DVC) into machine learning workflows.  
- Achieved reproducible and efficient ML experiments using YAML configurations and MLflow.  
- Collaborated with a research team to improve accuracy for medical imaging datasets.  
> _Note: This project is based on professional work and cannot be shared publicly due to confidentiality._

### [Python Attendance Tracker (Work Term Initiative)](https://github.com/Michael-Khoury/Python-Attendance-Tracker)  
- Self-initiated during a work term to streamline attendance tracking for myself, my supervisor, and future SI Leaders.  
- Automated tracking for over 50 students per session using Python with pandas and openpyxl.  
- Saved approximately 3–4 hours per week by eliminating manual Excel entry, reducing overall admin workload by 80%.  
- Enabled dynamic session logging and error-proof Excel output, leading to more consistent and reliable record-keeping across the semester.
